# Basics of optimizing VRChat worlds - Furality Somna panel

Here, you can download the full presentation, shaders, and all my benchmarks, so you can try them out for yourself!

The presentation is called "Basics of optimizing VRChat worlds.pdf", scroll up to find the file

Each folder starts with a number. That's the page number of the presentation, for instance "26 - Egg shader" is on the 26th page of the presentation.

You can open each folder, and open the Unity scene, there's a README file in each folder for additional context. Some benchmarks get saved in a .txt file, the txt file will be located at the project's root folder
