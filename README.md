# Basics of optimizing VRChat worlds

Here, you can download the full presentation, shaders, and all my benchmarks, so you can try them out for yourself!

Each folder starts with a number. That's the page number of the presentation, for instance "26 - Egg shader" is on the 26th page of the presentation.

You can open each folder, and open the Unity scene, there's a README file in each folder for additional context

## Installation

1) Unity 2022
2) Do not install the VRCSDK, it's a standalone project
3) To test the impostor system, you need the AutoLOD package, not included in this repository

## Credits

The tree model and textures were dowloaded from ambientCG and Polyhaven, they are licensed under the CC0 license.
The included shaders were all written by me, feel free to use them for your projects.
