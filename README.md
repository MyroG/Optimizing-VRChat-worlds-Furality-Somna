# Basics of optimizing VRChat worlds

Here, you can download the full presentation, shaders,  and all my benchmarks, so you can try them out for yourself!

Each folder starts with a number. That's the page number of the presentation, for instance "26 - Egg shader" is on the 26th page of the presentation

## Installation

1) Unity 2022
2) Do not install the VRCSDK, it's a standalone project
3) To test the impostor system, you need the AutoLOD package, not included in this repository
